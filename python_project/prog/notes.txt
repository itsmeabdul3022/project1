The code isolates the dotted number using match.group(1) and the description using match.group(2) because the regular expression has two separate capturing groups defined by parentheses ().

How Capturing Groups Work
r'description\s*:\s*"([\d.]+)\s*(.*?)"': This is the regular expression being used.

([\d.]+): This is the first capturing group. It captures and stores the sequence of digits and periods. The match.group(1) method specifically retrieves the content inside this set of parentheses.

(.*?): This is the second capturing group. It captures and stores the description text. The match.group(2) method retrieves this part.

By using separate capturing groups, the script can extract each piece of data independently, allowing it to use the description for matching and the dotted number for the replacement value.

eg:
pattern_b = re.compile(r'description\s*:\s*"([\d.]+)\s*(.*?)"')

file_b_data = {}
with open(file_b_path, 'r') as f_b:
            for line in f_b:
                match = pattern_b.search(line)
                if match:
                    dotted_number = match.group(1).strip()
                    other_data = match.group(2).strip().lower()
                    file_b_data[other_data] = dotted_number
